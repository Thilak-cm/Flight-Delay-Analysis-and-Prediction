# Airport Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models

## Overview

In this project, I conducted API-driven data analyses on some of the busiest airports globally, extracting key insights to inform the training of state-of-the-art machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Analysis:** Utilized API data to analyze and extract insights about the busiest airports.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Trained advanced machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and others using the extracted data.

- **Insightful Visualizations:** Created compelling visualizations to communicate key findings and patterns in the airport data.

- **Interactive App Deployment:** Developed a user-friendly front-end application using Streamlit, allowing public users to interact with and explore the analysis results.
